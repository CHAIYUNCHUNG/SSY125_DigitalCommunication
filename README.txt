This is the instructions of producing the figures used in project part 2 for Digital Communication SSY125
There are some files named belowed:
1. E1QPSK
2. E2QPSK
3. E2HARD
4. E3QPSK
5. E3BPSK
6. bpskdis
7. channel
8. distance
9. encoding
10. figureplot
11. qpsk_mapping
12. softdecode
13. softdecode_bpsk
14. stategenerator

1 to 5 are the files to generate the data in tasks
6 to 14 except 10 are the files of functions that used in generating data
10 is the files that run for producing the final figure that we need
